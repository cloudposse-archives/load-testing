A collection of workflows, scripts and scenarios that Cloud Posse uses for load and performance testing of websites and applications (in particular those deployed on Kubernetes clusters).

For load and performance testing, the workflow consists of these main steps:

1. Select and configure the tools to perform load testing
2. Implement load testing scenarios and scripts
3. Perform load testing, analyze the results, and suggest improvements and tuning procedures for the application/website under test
4. Tune and optimize the infrastructure and application/website
